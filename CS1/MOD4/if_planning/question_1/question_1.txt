Variables

• Canvas size
• Ellipse size
• Ball xSpeed
• Ball ySpeed
• Negative speed change
• Positive speed change

To start I would have the ellipse(ball) start in the top left (0, 0). The travelling of the ball would require multiple conditional statements.
If the ball is at the top, but X is less than width, then xSpeed should be positive. Once X is equal to width, the xSpeed should swith to 0
and ySpeed switch to positive. This process of changing the variables through the draw process will cause the ball to scroll across the 
top of the canvas, and then switch to travelling down the right hand side once it reaches the edge. 

The same can be done for the bottom right -> bottom left motion. Is the Y of the ball equal to height && X equal to width?
Then Y speed changes to 0 and X changes to a negative value. Once at the bottom left side, a similar if statement to check if the height
is equal to Y, AND the width is equal to 0. Then change speed on Y to negative and X to 0.
